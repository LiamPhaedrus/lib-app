#Shelfie

This is my capstone, or 'Breakable Toy', for Launch Academy. It is a web application to help users organize their books at home. For those of us who have a ton of books and don't remember where we put them, or still have books in boxes from three moves ago, Shelfie gives the user the ability to better keep track of where their books are.

#Technology

I integrated the following technologies and features in this project:

* Ruby on Rails back end with a PostgreSQL database
* React front-end for seamless user experience
* Drag and drop library implemented in React for ease of organizing books
* Foundation with custom CSS styling for responsive design

#Future Development

I have a variety of ideas for where this app could go next:

* Incorporate an external API (such as Goodreads) to make it much easier for users to add books
* Set up a suggested 'sort' function so that the app could sort the books by a variety of features, such as authors, categories, etc.
* Separate authors out from books so that users could more easily sort their books, especially in the case of implementing a sort function.
